eRupee (e₹) is First South Asian crypto-currency. Our Aim is to make blockchain technology accessible to every South Asian.

To achieve this goal, we have created e₹ 5,000,000,000,000 coins.

WHY ?
Now first question arises. When other organizations are limiting total supply to maximum 1 billion, then why we are going for these much of token supply ?

We have simple answer to it.

When people think about cryptocurrency they consider it as asset and rather than using it for transactions they store it. We strongly condemned that behavior.

OUR PLAN
To keep this eRupee currency as currency and not as a asset, our first move would be to keep it’s rates stable.

For that, we pledged to donate 90% e₹ from all token supply.

SO, HOW WE WILL DO THAT ?
We will provide e₹ 5000/- to every user in exchange of transaction fee which will cost around $0.3 to $5 (₹ 20 to ₹ 300).

Also, After completion of successful transaction you may tweet with #eRupeeRevolution .

By using this method, our plan is to create community of 900,000,000 active eRupee users at the end of 2018.

So, if you think this revolution should happen then you can send ether for transaction to this 0x81162167512A11d6F4E2c06c0560541489aE9175 ethereum address.

WHAT WILL BE THE INITIAL PRICING ?
The initial price of eRupee will be set to 1e₹ = 1₹.
